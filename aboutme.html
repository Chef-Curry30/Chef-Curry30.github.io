				Hello There viewer!<br>
                I am primarily an engineer at work and a avid sports follower when i am off work. A typical Indian employee ain't it ;)
                <br>
				<br>
				As of now I don't have any project that can prove my worth and I know my that I can produce at my level best or more in the upcoming project 
                I feel like I can perform the best when my back is against the wall
				At every stage of my life I had a mentor to guide me whether it's in life(my parents) or in work (my teachers).
                I can be potentially perform much better under guidance and working on performing a task without any supervision.
				<br>
				I worked on web development using MERN stack , HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, R, Python, C++, C, JAVA. In Python I have worked on libraries like Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Beautiful Soup.
                Platforms & Tools that i have used until now are Google Collaboratory, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, MS Office Applications, VS Code, MATLAB. 
                Proven leadership skills and ability to effectively communicate with stakeholders. Good ability to work in a fast-paced environment. 
                I have been the Class representative of the class from first semester till _____.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				Basketball (Golden State Warriors), rap, hip-hop, music, Cricket, tennis, stand-up comedy, and tinkering are among my other interests.
				I enjoy discussing startups, and right now, I'd give everything for a cup of coffee.
